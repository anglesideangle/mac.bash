# mac.bash

Ever seen your friend's `.DS_Store` files pushed to github and thought, "wow, I wish I could have that too?" With `mac.bash`, you can emulate the most important functionality of macos right in your linux shell.

Every time you `cd` into a directory, `macos` has a small chance of writing a `.DS_Store` file, containing some lovely ascii art.

To install, just clone this repository and add `source macos` to your `.bashrc`.

## Roadmap
